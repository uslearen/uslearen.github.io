          The Anglish Runes – <r>Þe   Aŋlish   Runes</r>
        </h1>
        <p>
          The font is
          <a href="font/AnglishNotoSansRegular.ttf">“Anglish Runes”</a>
          (click on the name to download the ttf), it’s adapted upon the font
          <b>“Noto Sans – Regular”</b>, meaning that except of the changed
          glyphs, the rest remains the original.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Although the term <b>'Anglish'</b> usually means English with
          non-germanic originating words removed, I have misappropriated it to
          name this font. As I thought that it was fitting because it is a
          script with the non-germanic glyphs removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The runes are based on the Anglo-Saxon/Frisian Runes (Futhorc)
          variance which, according to Wikipedia, have been used in England and
          the North of Netherlands from the 5th century onwards, up until the
          high middle ages
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern writing of runes, roughly falls in two categories. Those that
          write it phonetically and use the runes to write out the sounds. And
          those that replace the letters with the corresponding runes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this font was to use it as a drop in replacement for text
          written in English by switching the font, transliteration. It is not
          meant to be historically accurate, however many runes with attested
          sources are present.
        </p>
        <p>
          I choose specifically Futhorc runes to work upon as I feel this is
          more correct then using earlier Elder and Younger Futhark or later
          derived runes like Medieval or Dalecarlian, as the latter two where
          used primarily in the Scandinavian regions and not in England.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though this font is not intended to be historically accurate, I
          do believe that it is likely that a literate person from that
          historical era and area would be able to read what is written with
          this font, but may struggle with the meaning, as many words have been
          borrowed from other languages and beyond that have gone through
          multiple rounds of vowel shifting and added/discarded letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make it possible to transliterate modern English, certain letters
          had to be added, specifically the <b>V</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>Z</b>. I
          used the same method that has been used historically, for example the
          letter <b>C</b> and the letter <b>S</b> are phonetically similar, one
          form of the letter <b>S</b> is <r>S</r> which is just the <b>C</b>
          (<r>C</r>) upside down. Similar this has happened to letter <b>K</b>
          (<r>K</r>) and <b>X</b> (<r>X</r>). So for <b>V</b> I opted to use the
          upside down <b>F</b> (<r>F</r>) thus <r>V</r>. And for <b>Y</b> I used
          the upside down <b>J</b> (<r>J</r>), being <r>Y</r>. The letter
          <b>Z</b> I used the alternative <b>S</b> runic form being ᛊ and then
          put it up side down <r>Z</r>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The font has both upper case and lower case, these are the same
          symbols but the lower case is drawn in less height space.
          A common feature of runic inscriptions is that the words are not
          separated by a space but by a middle dot or colon like feature, this
          can be done by using the ‘Punctuation Space’ (<r>   </r>). 
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no attested runic numbers equivalent to the western Arabic
          numbers, as such I have created my own. The forms are roughly
          equivalent to the shape of the hand made when counting. For the other
          the punctuations I have just taken artistic liberty, as far as I know
          there is no precedence.

          On linux and unix systems you can use the compose key (by default
          right Shift + alt gr) and key combinations. On Windows you can either
          use alt keys or install a program that adds linux like compose
          functionality, for example
          <a href="https://github.com/SamHocevar/wincompose">this</a>.
