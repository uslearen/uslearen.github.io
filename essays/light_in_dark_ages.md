# Light and lightness in the Dark Ages: A Hypothesis on resilience by cattle.

## Abstract

Traditional narratives of early medieval Britain portray Anglo-Saxon life as one of scarcity and hardship, especially in winter when reduced daylight supposedly curtailed productivity due to the lack of affordable work light. This essay proposes an alternative: inland smallholdings achieved quiet abundance  and reliable winter lighting through a dairy-centred system that delivered year-round milk, butter and clarified butter. Small, hardy cattle, staggered calving, and integrated practices provided food security and enough light to sustain household crafts, population growth, and inland settlement. Surplus or rancid clarified butter could further contribute to hygiene by serving as a fat source for soft soap production. Drawing on zooarchaeological, linguistic, and residue evidence, this hypothesis challenges the prevailing “scarcity” paradigm, including assumptions of widespread malnutrition and poor hygiene stemming from limited fat sources, and suggests early medieval life was more settled and competent than commonly assumed.

## Introduction: The Scarcity Paradigm and Inland Settlement

Historians often describe the post-Roman centuries in Britain as a “Dark Age” of regression and subsistence struggle, with winter months particularly grim. Shortened daylight and the supposed absence of affordable work light are said to have limited productive hours. Good illumination was supposedly either too expensive (beeswax, olive oil), too calorically valuable as food (lard, fish oil, whale oil), or impractical (rushlights that burned for or an hour or less per stem requiring regular adjustment). Without reliable light, tasks such as spinning, weaving, and mending were thought to be severely restricted, reinforcing a picture of inactivity and hardship. Scarcity of fats is also assumed to have contributed to malnutrition and poor hygiene, limiting both nutrition and the ability to produce soap.

Yet Anglo-Saxon settlement expanded rapidly inland, far from coastal foraging opportunities. Why abandon marine resources if life was so precarious? This essay argues that inland migration reflected confidence, made possible by a reliable, self-reinforcing dairy system. Small herds of hardy cattle provided year-round milk, butter, and clarified butter that served as food, preservative, and lamp fuel. Crucially, clarified butter, even when rancid, burned cleanly and steadily for hours, extending productive winter hours for household crafts. Surplus or less edible portions could also be used in soap-making, improving personal and textile hygiene. This delivered caloric surplus and illumination without dependence on distant supplies or large-scale arable farming.

## The Dairy Core: Cattle as Wealth and Caloric Engine

In Old English, *feoh* meant both “cattle” and “wealth”—a linguistic clue to the centrality of bovines. Zooarchaeological evidence from sites such as West Stow, Yarnton, and Mucking shows small, compact cattle (shoulder height 80–90 cm), similar to modern Dexter, Gloucester, and Welsh Black breeds: hardy, high butterfat milk (3–4%), and capable of thriving on woodland browse and rough grazing.

A typical smallholding herd consisted of 8–15 cattle (mostly cows, one bull). With a bull permanently in the herd, natural heat cycles produced staggered calving across the year, ensuring continuous lactation. Even in winter, 10–14 cows on stored hay could yield 15–20 litres of milk daily. Traditional Irish and Alpine smallholder records confirm that 2–3 litres per cow per day from poor forage is realistic.

I speculate that the following was a common process; Raw milk not consumed fresh or made into cheese was skimmed for cream. The cream was churned into butter using simple wooden paddles (surviving examples from West Stow and Brandon). The skimmed milk was fermented into a thick yogurt-like product; the buttermilk left after churning served as a tangy drink, cooking ingredient, or pig feed. Surplus butter was gently heated and clarified, a stable, high-energy fat ideal for cooking, preservation, lighting, and potentially soap production.

## Clarified butter as Winter Fuel: Lighting, Hygiene, and Productivity

Traditional accounts struggle to explain inland winter illumination, due to alternative not being practical or expensive, assuming this means that there was only a limited amount of work done at night and thus low productivity.

However A teaspoon of clarified butter in a simple pottery lamp burns steadily for 3–4 hours with a mild, bright flame and a buttery odour, perfect for sustained tasks such as spinning wool, weaving linen, mending nets, or carving wood.

Additionally clarified butter could be combined with wood-ash lye to produce a soft soap, suitable for personal hygiene and washing clothes. Early medieval soap-making typically used rendered animal fats, and dairy surplus would provide an abundant, on-hand source, countering assumptions of fat scarcity limiting cleanliness.

## Implications: Abundance, Not Scarcity

Caloric security, reliable work light, and potential hygiene improvements explain several key patterns:

* Rapid inland settlement: Milk “travels” with the herd
* Strong selection for lactase persistence in northern European populations, consistent with lifelong milk consumption
* Sustained winter productivity: clarified butter lamps made household crafts feasible year-round

Rather than huddled desperation amid malnutrition and poor hygiene, winter days were likely occupied with milking, gathering firewood, harvesting winter greens and roots, and working by steady lamplight well into the evening.

## Conclusion

Zooarchaeological evidence (small high-fat cattle, calf cull patterns indicating staggered calving), lipid residues in domestic pottery (could be tallow or dairy), linguistic clues (*feoh*), and settlement patterns together support a dairy-driven abundance. Anglo-Saxon smallholdings were not fragile subsistence units but resilient, low-input systems capable of surplus and sustained productivity, with fats supporting not only nutrition and light but also basic hygiene.

This view does not romanticise the period, disease and inequality persisted, but it restores agency and practical competence to ordinary farmers, challenging notions of pervasive scarcity, driven malnutrition and uncleanliness.

Future research could target lipid residues in earlier domestic pottery for dairy specific signatures, evidence of soap production, or conduct isotopic studies of human bones to trace lifelong milk consumption.
