                <p>The common assumption that early medieval societies
                without widespread standardised coinage, such as Britain
                from c. 450-750 AD, relied primarily on barter is poorly
                supported by archaeological or ethnographic
                evidence.</p>
                <p>Anthropological research has thoroughly debunked the
                idea of pure barter economies. As Caroline Humphrey
                concluded in her 1985 article ‘Barter and Economic
                Disintegration’ “No example of a barter economy, pure
                and simple, has ever been described, let alone the
                emergence from it of money; all available ethnography
                suggests that there never has been such a thing.”</p>
                <p>David Graeber popularised this finding in his 2011
                book <em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em>, arguing that
                non-monetized communities typically rely on credit and
                debt arrangements, gift economies, or standardized
                objects that function as media of exchange, portable,
                useful items with broadly recognised value. These
                objects effectively serve the role of money, even if not
                minted coins. Labeling such systems “barter”
                misrepresents the social structures involved and
                overlooks practical adaptations.</p>
                <p>Graeber further observed that actual barter, when it
                does occur, almost never takes place within communities
                between neighbours or people with ongoing relationships.
                Instead, it ordinarily happens between strangers or even
                enemies, often in contexts of low trust, and can carry
                negative connotations of distrust or exploitation.</p>
                <p>Societies standardise around convenient goods: cowrie
                shells in parts of Africa and Asia, glass beads in some
                regions, or metal buttons elsewhere. I speculate that
                metal buttons where the precursor of coins, not just
                from the fact that they predate coins and they are
                visually similar. But also that standardise coinage
                usually is the result of trying to facilitate taxation
                or military payments. So when you need to standardise
                something you start usually from something that already
                exist and generalise on that thing.</p>
                <p>In early Anglo-Saxon Britain, small copper-alloy
                button brooches, durable fasteners made of valued
                material, appear frequently in various contexts,
                including graves, homes, workshops, and rural
                settlements, as witnessed by excavations and
                metal-detected finds, they could easily have facilitated
                small, everyday transactions, especially among unrelated
                people.</p>
                <p>For larger or formal exchanges, gold or silver
                jewellery, such as rings, earrings, brooches, and
                armlets, likely played a similar role, sometimes
                fragmented by weight as bullion in related periods.</p>
                <p>I can only think of one circumstance where barter is
                more common, and that would be in cases of swapping
                animals with further-afield neighbours, for example
                bulls, so that both benefit from “fresh” blood since the
                purpose is you are swapping like for like.</p>
                <p>In all other circumstances, I would say that a lack
                of minted coins does not mean a regressive barter
                economy. When formal coinage was scarce, people
                innovated with what was at hand, items like button
                brooches, to keep commerce flowing. This pattern recurs
                across history: humans are resourceful, and past
                societies were as organisationally capable as our
                own.</p>
