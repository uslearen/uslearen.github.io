                <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
                <p>Traditional narratives of early medieval Britain
                portray Anglo-Saxon life as one of scarcity and
                hardship, especially in winter when reduced daylight
                supposedly curtailed productivity due to the lack of
                affordable work light. This essay proposes an
                alternative: inland smallholdings achieved quiet
                abundance and reliable winter lighting through a
                dairy-centred system that delivered year-round milk,
                butter and clarified butter. Small, hardy cattle,
                staggered calving, and integrated practices provided
                food security and enough light to sustain household
                crafts, population growth, and inland settlement.
                Surplus or rancid clarified butter could further
                contribute to hygiene by serving as a fat source for
                soft soap production. Drawing on zooarchaeological,
                linguistic, and residue evidence, this hypothesis
                challenges the prevailing “scarcity” paradigm, including
                assumptions of widespread malnutrition and poor hygiene
                stemming from limited fat sources, and suggests early
                medieval life was more settled and competent than
                commonly assumed.</p>

                id="introduction-the-scarcity-paradigm-and-inland-settlement">Introduction:
                The Scarcity Paradigm and Inland Settlement</h2>
                <p>Historians often describe the post-Roman centuries in
                Britain as a “Dark Age” of regression and subsistence
                struggle, with winter months particularly grim.
                Shortened daylight and the supposed absence of
                affordable work light are said to have limited
                productive hours. Good illumination was supposedly
                either too expensive (beeswax, olive oil), too
                calorically valuable as food (lard, fish oil, whale
                oil), or impractical (rushlights that burned for or an
                hour or less per stem requiring regular adjustment).
                Without reliable light, tasks such as spinning, weaving,
                and mending were thought to be severely restricted,
                reinforcing a picture of inactivity and hardship.
                Scarcity of fats is also assumed to have contributed to
                malnutrition and poor hygiene, limiting both nutrition
                and the ability to produce soap.</p>
                <p>Yet Anglo-Saxon settlement expanded rapidly inland,
                far from coastal foraging opportunities. Why abandon
                marine resources if life was so precarious? This essay
                argues that inland migration reflected confidence, made
                possible by a reliable, self-reinforcing dairy system.
                Small herds of hardy cattle provided year-round milk,
                butter, and clarified butter that served as food,
                preservative, and lamp fuel. Crucially, clarified
                butter, even when rancid, burned cleanly and steadily
                for hours, extending productive winter hours for
                household crafts. Surplus or less edible portions could
                also be used in soap-making, improving personal and
                textile hygiene. This delivered caloric surplus and
                illumination without dependence on distant supplies or
                large-scale arable farming.</p>
                <h2
                id="the-dairy-core-cattle-as-wealth-and-caloric-engine">The
                Dairy Core: Cattle as Wealth and Caloric Engine</h2>
                <p>In Old English, <em>feoh</em> meant both “cattle” and
                “wealth”—a linguistic clue to the centrality of bovines.
                Zooarchaeological evidence from sites such as West Stow,
                Yarnton, and Mucking shows small, compact cattle
                (shoulder height 80–90 cm), similar to modern Dexter,
                Gloucester, and Welsh Black breeds: hardy, high
                butterfat milk (3–4%), and capable of thriving on
                woodland browse and rough grazing.</p>
                <p>A typical smallholding herd consisted of 8–15 cattle
                (mostly cows, one bull). With a bull permanently in the
                herd, natural heat cycles produced staggered calving
                across the year, ensuring continuous lactation. Even in
                winter, 10–14 cows on stored hay could yield 15–20
                litres of milk daily. Traditional Irish and Alpine
                smallholder records confirm that 2–3 litres per cow per
                day from poor forage is realistic.</p>
                <p>I speculate that the following was a common process;
                Raw milk not consumed fresh or made into cheese was
                skimmed for cream. The cream was churned into butter
                using simple wooden paddles (surviving examples from
                West Stow and Brandon). The skimmed milk was fermented
                into a thick yogurt-like product; the buttermilk left
                after churning served as a tangy drink, cooking
                ingredient, or pig feed. Surplus butter was gently
                heated and clarified, a stable, high-energy fat ideal
                for cooking, preservation, lighting, and potentially
                soap production.</p>
                <h2
                id="clarified-butter-as-winter-fuel-lighting-hygiene-and-productivity">Clarified
                butter as Winter Fuel: Lighting, Hygiene, and
                Productivity</h2>
                <p>Traditional accounts struggle to explain inland
                winter illumination, due to alternative not being
                practical or expensive, assuming this means that there
                was only a limited amount of work done at night and thus
                low productivity.</p>
                <p>However A teaspoon of clarified butter in a simple
                pottery lamp burns steadily for 3–4 hours with a mild,
                bright flame and a buttery odour, perfect for sustained
                tasks such as spinning wool, weaving linen, mending
                nets, or carving wood.</p>
                <p>Additionally clarified butter could be combined with
                wood-ash lye to produce a soft soap, suitable for
                personal hygiene and washing clothes. Early medieval
                soap-making typically used rendered animal fats, and
                dairy surplus would provide an abundant, on-hand source,
                countering assumptions of fat scarcity limiting
                cleanliness.</p>
                <h2
                id="implications-abundance-not-scarcity">Implications:
                Abundance, Not Scarcity</h2>
                <p>Caloric security, reliable work light, and potential
                hygiene improvements explain several key patterns:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Rapid inland settlement: Milk “travels” with the
                herd</li>
                <li>Strong selection for lactase persistence in northern
                European populations, consistent with lifelong milk
                consumption</li>
                <li>Sustained winter productivity: clarified butter
                lamps made household crafts feasible year-round</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Rather than huddled desperation amid malnutrition and
                poor hygiene, winter days were likely occupied with
                milking, gathering firewood, harvesting winter greens
                and roots, and working by steady lamplight well into the
                evening.</p>
                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Zooarchaeological evidence (small high-fat cattle,
                calf cull patterns indicating staggered calving), lipid
                residues in domestic pottery (could be tallow or dairy),
                linguistic clues (<em>feoh</em>), and settlement
                patterns together support a dairy-driven abundance.
                Anglo-Saxon smallholdings were not fragile subsistence
                units but resilient, low-input systems capable of
                surplus and sustained productivity, with fats supporting
                not only nutrition and light but also basic hygiene.</p>
                <p>This view does not romanticise the period, disease
                and inequality persisted, but it restores agency and
                practical competence to ordinary farmers, challenging
                notions of pervasive scarcity, driven malnutrition and
                uncleanliness.</p>
                <p>Future research could target lipid residues in
                earlier domestic pottery for dairy specific signatures,
                evidence of soap production, or conduct isotopic studies
                of human bones to trace lifelong milk consumption.</p>
