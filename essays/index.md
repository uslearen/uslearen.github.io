# The Armchair Hypothesist 

The essays you find here are the result of doing armchair experiments. I enjoy thinking about these and documenting them. And since I gone to the trouble of writing them down, I might as well publish them. However it should be noted that most of these topics I have no actual experience with, I just like taking a hypothetical and then run with it.
